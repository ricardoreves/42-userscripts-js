# 42 UserScripts JS

## 🤔 What is a User Script?
Userscripts (a.k.a User Scripts, User scripts, or .user.js) are open-source licensed add-ons for web browsers, written in JavaScript, that change web pages as they are loaded. They give users the power to make websites do what they want them to, rather than what was originally intended.

## 🚀 Getting Started

#### 🐵 Install browser extension
It requires the installation of an extension specific to your browser. These extensions help simplify management tasks like installing, removing and updating userscripts.
- [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is the most popular userscript manager.

#### 👤 Install userscripts
Now that you have installed the extension, you can install one of the scripts below.
- [42 User Location](https://github.com/ricardoreves/42-userscripts-js/raw/master/scripts/42-user-location.user.js): Add the map of the cluster in the profile page and highlight the position of the user.

*⚠️ For the moment this script only works for [42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/)*
